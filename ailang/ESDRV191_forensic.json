COPY EXCBS070)      *\n003000*          - ADDED DATE CHECKS FOR CY2007 AND CALL ESCAL070      *\n003100* 12/28/06 - ADDED DATE CHECKS FOR CY2007 APRIL AND CALL ESCAL071*\n003200*          - CREATED ENTER AND EXIT PARAGRAPHS FOR CLARITY       *\n003300*          - STREAMLINED THE PROCESSING SO THAT IT IS MORE       *\n003400*            EFFICIENT                                           *\n003500*          - PROVIDED A DRIVER VERSION NUMBER WHICH WILL BE      *\n003600*            PASSED BACK (IN THE PPS-CALC-VERS-CD) INDICATING AN *\n003700*            INTERNAL ERROR THAT IS FOUND AND THUS THE CALCULATE *\n003800*            SUBROUTINE IS NOT CALLED                            *\n003900* 01/30/07 - NEW MSA AND CBSA TABLES WHICH INCLUDE THE LATEST    *\n004000*            ADDITIONS TO THE STATE CODES PER CR#5490 AND CMSO   *\n004100*            DATA ON WEB SITE                                    *\n004200* 11/27/07 - ADDED SEVERAL 'IF' TESTS TO CHECK FOR WHEN CBSAS ARE*\n004300*            DELETED OR ADDED IN VARIOUS CLAIM YEARS.  THIS WAS  *\n004400*            NECESSARY SINCE I DISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT THAT BOB   *\n004500*            CHRISTY NEGLECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CBSAS CHANGING OVER*\n004600*            TIME.  THESE TESTS ARE TEMPORARY SO THAT THE PRICER *\n004700*            CAN BE DELIVERED TO THE FISCAL INTERMEDIARIES ON    *\n004800*            TIME RATHER THAN TRYING TO TAKE THE TIME TO DEVISE A*\n004900*            SEARCH-ALL TABLE WHICH WOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF CBSAS  *\n005000*            CHANGING OVER TIME.                                 *\n005100* 06/04/08 - Added Copylib which enables this subprogram to act  *\n005200*            the same on the IBM mainframe as well as on the PC  *\n005300*            under MicroFocus COBOL.  The Copylib is technically *\n005400*            slightly different on both systems which enables the*\n005500*            test switch to operate correctly without any        *\n005600*            standard COBOL changes between the systems.  The    *\n005700*            EXACT same code shown in this listing (minus the    *\n005800*            Copylib) WILL operate on both systems.  Therefore   *\n005900*            there are no problems with synchronizing two        *\n006000*            different source codes - - which, from experience,  *\n006100*            will get out of sync over time.                     *\n006200*          - Added different return codes to differentiate the   *\n006300*            errors encountered.  These additional return codes  *\n006400*            affect only the manager main-program which runs on  *\n006500*            the PC.  They do not affect the running of this     *\n006600*            subroutine on the IBM mainframe and will NOT impact *\n006700*            'FISS' because only those codes contained in the    *\n006800*            manual (IOM) are returned to 'FISS'.                *\n006900*          - New CBSA Table for CY2009 (I.E. Copy EXCBS091       *\n007000*          - Added date checks for CY2009 and CALL ESCAL091      *\n007100* 12/03/08 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV091 and changed the    *\n007200*            appropriate version information.  The 9.0 version of*\n007300*            the driver was sent out in November.  Afterwards the*\n007400*            policy people who set the wage indexes, changed     *\n007500*            their minds about CBSA 16700 and rescinded the new  *\n007600*            wage index. This necessitated a re-release of the   *\n007700*            ESRD dirver in order to make sure that the FI'S are *\n007800*            using the latest version at the start of CY2009.    *\n007900* 11/01/09 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV100 and changed the    *\n008000*            appropriate version information.  The 10.0 version  *\n008100*            of the driver was sent out in November.             *\n008200*          - Removed the ability to process 2005 claims.         *\n008300*          - Added features which will make the driver able to   *\n008400*            handle the new Bundled wage-index table and process *\n008500*            those claims.  However, for this release, these     *\n008600*            added features were commented out to speed up       *\n008700*            processing.  There are other additions that need    *\n008800*            to be made such as the length of the input record   *\n008900*            in order for the 2011 driver and pricer to work.    *\n009000* 01/08/10 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV101 and changed the    *\n009100*            appropriate version information.  The 10.1 version  *\n009200*            of the driver was sent out in mid January.          *\n009300*          - Because of a request by FISS and the MACs due to    *\n009400*            requirements mandated by the OIG and CWF, the       *\n009500*            ability to process 2005 claims was restored.  In    *\n009600*            addition, to make this pricer conform to the rules  *\n009700*            established with the IPPS Pricer, the ESRD Pricer   *\n009800*            will be a 10 year rolling pricer.                   *\n009900* 01/21/10 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV102 and changed the    *\n010000*            appropriate version information.  The 10.2 version  *\n010100*            of the driver was sent out in late January.         *\n010200*          - Fixed a slip-up in restoring the capability to      *\n010300*            process 2005 claims.  My test file had real CBSA    *\n010400*            values when it should have had blank values in that *\n010500*            field, which is the case for 2005 claims.           *\n010600* 08/04/10 - Renamed this subroutine ESRDRV110 and changed the   *\n010700*            input and output file layout.  Installed the new    *\n010800*            bundled (now called just PPS - the old methodology  *\n010900*            will now be called composite rate) wage index table.*\n011000* 11/09/10   Corrected the problem with CBSA 16700 for 2009 in   *\n011100*            the composite rate table.  The latest wage indexes  *\n011200*            from Suzanne Asplen's spreadsheet dated 10/27/2010  *\n011300*            installed for both Bundled (PPS) and Composite Rate *\n011400*            tables.  Updated the 0400-CHECK-CBSA-ADDS-DELETES   *\n011500*            paragraph with 2011 CBSA changes.                   *\n011600* 03/09/11   Renamed this subroutine ESDRV116 due to conformitity*\n011700*            with the Calculate subroutine and also due to the   *\n011800*            reworking of the copylib so that it used the same   *\n011900*            ones that the calculate subroutines use.            *\n012000* 10/28/11   Renamed this subroutine ESDRV120 due to conformitity*\n012100*            with the Calculate subroutine.                      *\n012200* 12/02/11   Renamed this subroutine ESDRV121 due to conformitity*\n012300*            with the Calculate subroutine.                      *\n012400* 10/19/12   ESDRV130 created for the CY 2013 ESRD Pricer.\n012500*            - Added comments concerning this release\n012600*            - Changed W-STORAGE-REF to ESRD D13.0\n012700*            - Added  the following line to the WORKING-STORAGE\n012800*              SECTION to add the name of the new Calculation\n012900*              subprogram -->\n013000*                 01  ESCAL130       PIC X(08) VALUE 'ESCAL130'.\n013100*            - Changed COPY ESWRT121. to COPY ESWRT130. For MSA\n013200*              Wage Index, which is no longer updated, just\n013300*              renamed.\n013400*            - Changed COPY ESCOM121. to COPY ESCOM130. to use\n013500*              the latest Composite Wage Index.\n013600*            - Changed COPY ESBUN121. to COPY ESBUN130. To use\n013700*              the latest Bundled (PPS) Wage Index.\n013800*            - Added section to code to CALL the new Calculation\n013900*              Subprogram (ESCAL130)\n014000*            - Since the CY 2013 ESRD Pricer update included\n014100*              changes to the Calculation subprograms for\n014200*              both 2012 and 2011, replaced\n014300*              ESCAL116 with ESCAL117, and ESCAL121 with\n014400*              ESCAL122 where needed.\n014500* 11/15/13 ESDRV14B - TEST ONLY BETA VERSION\n014600*          CREATED TO GIVE FISS SOMETHING TO TEST NOW BECAUSE\n014700*          THE FINAL RULE WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR ANOTHER\n014800*          MONTH\n014900*          MADE CHANGES TO ENSURE THAT PACIFIC RIM FACILITIES\n015000*          ARE NOW PAID USING THE SAME CALCULATIONS AS\n015100*          FACILITIES FROM OTHER AREAS\n015200* 11/18/13 ESDRV140 - normal yearly release\n015300*       This Driver module includes new logic\n015400*       that directs Pacific Rim providers to flow through the\n015500*       same pricing calculation as all other providers.

THIS WAS  *\n// NECESSARY SINCE I DISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT THAT BOB   *\n// CHRISTY NEGLECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CBSAS CHANGING OVER*\n// TIME.

The Copylib is technically *\n// slightly different on both systems which enables the*\n// test switch to operate correctly without any        *\n// standard COBOL changes between the systems.

These additional return codes  *\n// affect only the manager main-program which runs on  *\n// the PC.  They do not affect the running of this     *\n// subroutine on the IBM mainframe and will NOT impact *\n// 'FISS' because only those codes contained in the    *\n// manual (IOM) are returned to 'FISS'.                *\n// - New CBSA Table for CY2009 (I.E. Copy EXCBS091       *\n// - Added date checks for CY2009 and CALL ESCAL091      *\n// 12/03/08 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV091 and changed the    *\n// appropriate version information.  The 9.0 version of*\n// the driver was sent out in November.  Afterwards the*\n// policy people who set the wage indexes, changed     *\n// their minds about CBSA 16700 and rescinded the new  *\n// wage index. This necessitated a re-release of the   *\n// ESRD dirver in order to make sure that the FI'S are *\n// using the latest version at the start of CY2009.    *\n// 11/01/09 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV100 and changed the    *\n// appropriate version information.  The 10.0 version  *\n// of the driver was sent out in November.             *\n// - Removed the ability to process 2005 claims.         *\n// - Added features which will make the driver able to   *\n// handle the new Bundled wage-index table and process *\n// those claims.  However, for this release, these     *\n// added features were commented out to speed up       *\n// processing.  There are other additions that need    *\n// to be made such as the length of the input record   *\n// in order for the 2011 driver and pricer to work.    *\n// 01/08/10 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV101 and changed the    *\n// appropriate version information.  The 10.1 version  *\n// of the driver was sent out in mid January.          *\n// - Because of a request by FISS and the MACs due to    *\n// requirements mandated by the OIG and CWF, the       *\n// ability to process 2005 claims was restored.  In    *\n// addition, to make this pricer conform to the rules  *\n// established with the IPPS Pricer, the ESRD Pricer   *\n// will be a 10 year rolling pricer.                   *\n// 01/21/10 - Renamed this subroutine ESDRV102 and changed the    *\n// appropriate version information.  The 10.2 version  *\n// of the driver was sent out in late January.         *\n// - Fixed a slip-up in restoring the capability to      *\n// process 2005 claims.  My test file had real CBSA    *\n// values when it should have had blank values in that *\n// field, which is the case for 2005 claims.           *\n// 08/04/10 - Renamed this subroutine ESRDRV110 and changed the   *\n// input and output file layout.  Installed the new    *\n// bundled (now called just PPS - the old methodology  *\n// will now be called composite rate) wage index table.*\n// 11/09/10   Corrected the problem with CBSA 16700 for 2009 in   *\n// the composite rate table.  The latest wage indexes  *\n// from Suzanne Asplen's spreadsheet dated 10/27/2010  *\n// installed for both Bundled (PPS) and Composite Rate *\n// tables.  Updated the 0400-CHECK-CBSA-ADDS-DELETES   *\n// paragraph with 2011 CBSA changes.                   *\n// 03/09/11   Renamed this subroutine ESDRV116 due to conformitity*\n// with the Calculate subroutine and also due to the   *\n// reworking of the copylib so that it used the same   *\n// ones that the calculate subroutines use.            *\n// 10/28/11   Renamed this subroutine ESDRV120 due to conformitity*\n// with the Calculate subroutine.                      *\n// 12/02/11   Renamed this subroutine ESDRV121 due to conformitity*\n// with the Calculate subroutine.                      *\n// 10/19/12   ESDRV130 created for the CY 2013 ESRD Pricer.\n// - Added comments concerning this release\n// - Changed W-STORAGE-REF to ESRD D13.0\n// - Added  the following line to the WORKING-STORAGE\n// SECTION to add the name of the new Calculation\n// subprogram -->\n// 01  ESCAL130       PIC X(08) VALUE 'ESCAL130'.\n// - Changed COPY ESWRT121. to COPY ESWRT130. For MSA\n// Wage Index, which is no longer updated, just\n// renamed.\n// - Changed COPY ESCOM121. to COPY ESCOM130. to use\n// the latest Composite Wage Index.\n// - Changed COPY ESBUN121. to COPY ESBUN130. To use\n// the latest Bundled (PPS) Wage Index.\n// - Added section to code to CALL the new Calculation\n// Subprogram (ESCAL130)\n// - Since the CY 2013 ESRD Pricer update included\n// changes to the Calculation subprograms for\n// both 2012 and 2011, replaced\n// ESCAL116 with ESCAL117, and ESCAL121 with\n// ESCAL122 where needed.\n// 11/15/13 ESDRV14B - TEST ONLY BETA VERSION\n// CREATED TO GIVE FISS SOMETHING TO TEST NOW BECAUSE\n// THE FINAL RULE WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR ANOTHER\n// MONTH\n// MADE CHANGES TO ENSURE THAT PACIFIC RIM FACILITIES\n// ARE NOW PAID USING THE SAME CALCULATIONS AS\n// FACILITIES FROM OTHER AREAS\n// 11/18/13 ESDRV140 - normal yearly release\n// This Driver module includes new logic\n// that directs Pacific Rim providers to flow through the\n// same pricing calculation as all other providers. This\n// logic was tested in the Beta version (ESDRV14B).\n// 11/15/14 ESDRV150 - normal yearly release\n// added code to the 0800-FIND-BUNDLED-CBSA-WI to check to\n// make sure that the Wage Index being used to price the\n// claim is equal to the year of the claim in B-THRU-DATE\n// 12/23/14 ESDRV151 - implement use of Special Wage Indexes for\n// certain Children's Hospitals\n// 11/16/15 UPDATED FOR CY 2016 VERSION 0\n// Stop using 0400-CHECK-CBSA-ADDS-DELETES.\n// 09/07/16 - VERSION 17.B FOR TESTING ONLY\n// 10/19/16 - VERSION 17.0 - CR9807 - CY 2017 ANNUAL UPDATE\n// 03/16/17 - VERSION 17.1 - CR9609 - ADD RETRAINING - JULY 1, 2017\n// 06/15/17 - VERSION 18.B - BETA VERSION TO TEST TDAPA\n// 10/02/18 - VERSION 18.C - 2ND BETA VERSION TO TEST TDAPA\n// 10/24/18 - VERSION 18.0 - CR10312 - CY2018 ANNUAL UPDATE\n// 07  50%  \"       yes*    yes                07.0    XXXXXXXX\n// 07  50%  \"       yes*    yes                07.1    XXXXXXXX\n// 08  75%  \"       yes*    yes                08.0    XXXXXXXXX\n// 09 100%  \"       yes*    yes                09.1    XXXXXXXXXX\n// 10 100%  \"       yes*    yes                10.0    XXXXXXXXXXX\n// 11  25%Bundled   yes*    yes        yes     11.0    XXXXXXXXXXXX\n// 12  50%  \"       yes*    yes        yes     12.0    XXXXXXXXXXXXX\n// 13  75%  \"       yes*    yes        yes     13.0    XXXXXXXXXXXXX\n// 14 100%  \"       yes*    yes*       yes     14.0    XXXXXXXXXXXXX\n// 15 100%  \"       yes*    yes*       yes     15.0    XXXXXXXXXXXXX\n// 16 100%  \"       yes*    yes*       yes     16.0     XXXXXXXXXXXX\n// 17 100%  \"       yes*    yes*       yes     17.0      XXXXXXXXXXX\n// 18 100%  \"       yes*    yes*       yes     18.0       XXXXXXXXXX\n// 19 100%  \"        no     yes*       yes     19.0        XXXXXXXXX\n// 20 100%  \"        no     yes*       yes     20.0         XXXXXXXX\n// 21 100%  \"        no     yes*       yes     21.0          XXXXXXX\n// 22 100%  \"        no     yes*       yes     22.0           XXXXXX\n// 23 100%  \"        no     yes*       yes     23.0            XXXXX\n// 24 100%  \"        no      no        yes     24.0             XXXX\n// end of the blending period.
