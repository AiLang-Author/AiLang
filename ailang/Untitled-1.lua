Other High-Priority Commands:
Beyond the hash commands, these are commonly used in production:
Lists:

LLEN - Get list length (you have this)
LPOP/RPOP - Remove and return element
LINDEX - Get element by index
LSET - Set element by index

Keys:

KEYS pattern - Find keys matching pattern (careful - can be slow)
SCAN cursor - Iterate keys safely
RENAME old new - Rename a key

Transactions:

MULTI - Start transaction
EXEC - Execute transaction
DISCARD - Cancel transaction

The most impactful would be completing the hash commands first since they're heavily used for object storage patterns in Redis. HGETALL specifically is critical for fetching complete objects.
Once Gemini finishes HGETALL, test it thoroughly - it's one of the most complex commands because it needs to properly format alternating field-value pairs in the RESP array format.
// HSET - Set one or mOf course! Implementing a proper EXEC is a fantastic next step, as it brings your server's transaction capabilities to life. The current implementation correctly queues commands, but making it execute them requires a thoughtful refactoring to avoid duplicating the entire command dispatch logic.

The best way to approach this is to refactor the main command processing logic into its own reusable function. This is a common and powerful pattern in software engineering that promotes code reuse and maintainability.

Here is a sketch of how you can achieve this:

The Plan
Create a DispatchCommand Helper Function: We'll move the large If/ElseIf block that checks for PING, SET, GET, etc., from the main HandleClient loop into a new helper function called Server.Internal.DispatchCommand. This function will take a command array and return the corresponding RESP response.
Simplify HandleClient: The main loop will now simply call this new helper function, making the code much cleaner.
Implement EXEC: The EXEC handler will loop through the queued commands, call the DispatchCommand helper for each one, and collect the results into an array to be returned to the client.
This approach is clean, avoids code duplication, and makes your server's architecture more robust.

The Code Sketch
Here is the patch for redis_server.ailang that implements this refactoring. It introduces the new helper function and updates EXEC to use it.

How It Works
Server.Internal.DispatchCommand: This new function now contains the large If/ElseIf block for all your commands. It takes a command_array and the store pointer as input. Crucially, it returns an XArray containing not just the response string, but also all the pointers to data structures (response_source_array, etc.) that need to be cleaned up later.
EXEC Handler:
It iterates through the command_queue.
For each queued command, it calls Server.Internal.DispatchCommand.
It extracts the response string from the result and adds it to a results array.
It uses RESP.Array to format the final array of responses.
Memory Management Note: As noted in the code comments, this sketch introduces a new memory management challenge. The EXEC command now generates a list of responses, each of which might have its own associated memory to clean up (like the values from HGETALL). A complete implementation would require a more advanced cleanup mechanism to handle this nested structure, but for now, this sketch correctly demonstrates the command execution logic.
This refactoring is a significant step toward a more modular and maintainable server architecture.ore hash fields
